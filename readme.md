# Creating a Web App for a Facebook Prophet Time Series Model üìà

The aim of this project is to deploy a time series regression analysis model. My model of choice was built using Facebook Prophet with external regressors (transaction and on promotions) and the in-built holiday effect feature of Facebook Prophet. 

- The model (Facebook Prophet) can be found in the model folder
- The source code can be found in the src folder
- The needed CSV files can be found in the data frames folder. 
- The Notebook folder contains the Notebook I used for my EDA and a comparison of the model 
- I used the Virtualevn Python environment
